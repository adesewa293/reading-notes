## Markdown 

Markdown is a lightweight markup language commonly used for formatting text. It is often used to create richly formatted documents, such as README files on code repositories, documentation, or simple web pages. Markdown uses plain text syntax that is easy to read and write, while also allowing for basic formatting.

Some commonly used Markdown syntax includes:

- Headings: Use hash symbols (`#`) to indicate heading levels (e.g., `# Heading 1`, `## Heading 2`, etc.).
- Emphasis: Surround text with asterisks (`*`) or underscores (`_`) to make it italic, and use double asterisks (`**`) or double underscores (`__`) to make it bold.
- Lists: Create unordered lists using dashes (`-`), plus signs (`+`), or asterisks (`*`), and ordered lists using numbers followed by periods (`1.`, `2.`, etc.).
- Links: Wrap link text in square brackets (`[]`) and the URL or file path in parentheses (`()`).
- Images: Similar to links, but with an exclamation mark (`!`) before the square brackets.
- Code blocks: Indent code with four spaces or use triple backticks (```) to create code blocks.
- Horizontal rules: Create horizontal rules with three or more hyphens (`-`), asterisks (`*`), or underscores (`_`).

These are just a few examples of Markdown syntax. 
Markdown files typically have a `.md` extension. They can be viewed and rendered in various editors, including VSCode, and converted to other formats like HTML or PDF.
