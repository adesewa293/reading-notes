**What is HTML and why do we use it?**
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a standard markup language used for creating the structure and content of web pages. We use HTML to define the elements and their organization on a webpage, enabling us to present text, images, links, and other media in a structured format that can be rendered by web browsers.

**What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?**
The three main parts of an HTML element are the opening tag, the content (text or other nested elements), and the closing tag. These parts collectively define and enclose the element and its purpose.

**What is it called when you give an element extra information?**
When you give an element extra information, it is referred to as providing attributes to the element. Attributes provide additional details or instructions about an element, such as its styling, behavior, or accessibility features.

**What is a semantic element?**
A semantic element in HTML is an element that carries meaning, conveying the purpose and structure of its content to both developers and machines. Semantic elements have inherent semantic value and help improve the readability, accessibility, and search engine optimization of web pages. Examples of semantic elements include `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, and more.
