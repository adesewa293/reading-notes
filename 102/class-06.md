**What are variables in JavaScript?**
Variables in JavaScript are containers for storing data values. They allow you to store and manipulate data of different types, such as numbers, strings, booleans, and objects. Variables can hold values that can change during the execution of a program.

**What does it mean to declare a variable?**
Declaring a variable in JavaScript involves defining its name and optionally assigning an initial value. It reserves memory space to store the value and associates the variable name with that memory location.

**What is an "assignment" operator, and what does it do?**
An "assignment" operator in JavaScript is denoted by the equals sign (`=`). It is used to assign a value to a variable. The assignment operator takes the value on the right side and assigns it to the variable on the left side.

**What is information received from the user called?**
Information received from the user is typically referred to as user input. In JavaScript, user input can be obtained through various means, such as text input fields, prompts, or interactions with the web page, and can be stored in variables for further processing.
