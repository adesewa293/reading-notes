**What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?**
To invoke or call a function means to execute the code inside the function. By using the function name followed by parentheses, you trigger the execution of the function's statements, which can include any defined logic, operations, or actions.

**What are the parentheses () for when you define a function?**
The parentheses in a function definition are used to declare parameters. Parameters act as placeholders for values that will be passed into the function when it is called. They allow functions to accept inputs or arguments that can be used within the function's code.
