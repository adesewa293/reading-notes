**What is the purpose of CSS?**
The purpose of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is to control the visual presentation and styling of HTML documents. CSS allows developers to define the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of web pages, enhancing the overall design and user experience.

**What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?**
The three ways to insert CSS into a project are:
1. Inline CSS: Applying CSS directly to HTML elements using the `style` attribute.
2. Internal CSS: Defining CSS rules within the `<style>` tags in the HTML document's head section.
3. External CSS: Linking an external CSS file to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag.

**Example CSS rule that would give all `<p>` elements red text:**
```css
p {
  color: red;
}
```
