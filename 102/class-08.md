**What is an expression in JavaScript?**
An expression in JavaScript is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that produce a result. It can be as simple as a single value or as complex as a combination of multiple operations. Expressions are evaluated to produce a value.

**Why would we use a loop in our code?**
We use loops in our code when we want to repeat a block of code multiple times. Loops provide a way to automate repetitive tasks, iterate over collections of data, or execute a certain set of instructions until a specific condition is met.

**When does a for loop stop executing?**
A for loop stops executing when the condition specified in the loop's parameters evaluates to false. The condition is checked before each iteration of the loop. If the condition is initially false, the loop will not execute at all.

**How many times will a while loop execute?**
A while loop will execute as long as the condition specified in the loop's parentheses evaluates to true. The number of times a while loop executes depends on when the condition becomes false. If the condition is initially false, the loop will not execute at all.
