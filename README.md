#### Growth Mindset
Having a growth mindset is like having a boundless garden of possibilities,  where the seeds of potential are nurtured and they bloom into magnificent flowers of achievements. It is a mindset that sees challenges as stepping stones, setbacks as opportunities for learning and effort as a rich soil that fuels personal growth. 

1. I would embrace challenges as opportunities for growth.
2. I would put in effort and persist in the face of setbacks.
3. I will foster a thirst for learning and embrace feedback.

By keeping these reminders in mind, I can cultivate a mindset that embraces growth, resilience, and continuous improvement.
