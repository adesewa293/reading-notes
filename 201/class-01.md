**What is an HTML attribute?**
An HTML attribute provides additional information or modifies the behavior of an HTML element. Attributes are placed within the start tag of an element and consist of a name and a value.

**Describe the Anatomy of an HTML element:**
An HTML element consists of an opening tag, content (which may include nested elements), and a closing tag. The opening tag begins with a less-than symbol (<), followed by the element name, attributes (optional), and ends with a greater-than symbol (>). The closing tag starts with a less-than symbol (<), followed by a forward slash (/), the element name, and ends with a greater-than symbol (>). The content is placed between the opening and closing tags.

**What is the Difference between `<article>` and `<section>` element tags?**
The `<article>` element represents a self-contained composition that can be independently distributed or reused, such as a blog post or news article. On the other hand, the `<section>` element represents a standalone section of content within a document, often with a related theme or purpose.

**What Elements does a "typical" website include?**
A typical website includes elements such as a header (usually containing a logo and navigation), main content section, sidebar, footer, and various other components like images, forms, and links.

**How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimization?**
Metadata, such as title tags, meta descriptions, and structured data, provides information to search engines about the content and purpose of a web page. Properly optimized metadata can positively influence search engine rankings and improve the visibility and click-through rate of a website in search results.

**How is the `<meta>` HTML tag used when specifying metadata?**
The `<meta>` tag is used in the head section of an HTML document to specify various types of metadata. It can be used to define the character encoding, set the viewport for responsive design, provide metadata for search engines, and more.

**How to start to design a Website:**
The first step to designing a website is to gather requirements and establish a clear vision for the website's purpose, target audience, and desired features.

**What is the most important question to answer when designing a Website?**
The most important question to answer when designing a website is: "What goals or objectives does the website aim to achieve?" Understanding the purpose and goals of the website helps guide the design process and ensure it aligns with the desired outcomes.

**Why should you use an `<h1>` element over a `<span>` element to display a top-level heading?**
Using an `<h1>` element provides semantic meaning to the top-level heading, indicating its importance and hierarchical structure. It also aids in accessibility and search engine optimization by conveying the document's structure to assistive technologies and search engine crawlers.

**What are the benefits of using semantic tags in our HTML?**
Using semantic tags in HTML improves the structure and readability of the code, making it more meaningful and easier to understand for both developers and assistive technologies. Semantic tags also contribute to better search engine optimization and facilitate the creation of accessible websites.

**What is JavaScript?**
JavaScript is a high-level programming language that allows developers to add interactivity, dynamic behavior, and functionality to websites. It is primarily executed in web browsers and enables tasks such as form validation, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous requests.

**Describe 2 things that require JavaScript in the Browser?**
Two common use cases for JavaScript in the browser are form validation, where JavaScript can validate user input before submission, and dynamic content updates, where JavaScript can fetch data from a server and update the webpage without requiring a full page reload.

**How can you add JavaScript to an HTML document?**
JavaScript can be added to an HTML document by using the `<script>` element
