Understanding the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is crucial for anyone studying web development or design. These three fundamental technologies form the backbone of modern websites and web applications.

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating the structure and content of web pages. It provides the building blocks for organizing and presenting information on the web. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is responsible for the visual appearance of a web page, allowing developers to control layout, colors, fonts, and other stylistic elements. JavaScript, on the other hand, is a powerful programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to websites.

In this module, gaining a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript helped me to create captivating and responsive web page. From designing the layout and styling elements to adding interactive features and animations, these technologies are essential tools in web development toolkit.

By diving into the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, i acquireD the necessary skills to create professional-looking websites, enhance user experience, and bring your web design visions to life.

###HTML
**Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?**
Using semantic elements in HTML improves the accessibility and SEO of a website, making it easier for search engines and assistive technologies to understand the content and structure.

**How many levels of headings are there in HTML?**
HTML provides six levels of headings, ranging from `<h1>` (the highest level) to `<h6>` (the lowest level), allowing for hierarchical organization of content.

**What are some uses for the `<sup>` and `<sub>` elements?**
The `<sup>` element is used to display superscript text, often for footnotes or mathematical notations, while the `<sub>` element is used for subscript text, commonly seen in chemical formulas or mathematical equations.

**When using the `<abbr>` element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?**
To provide the full expansion of an abbreviation or acronym using the `<abbr>` element, the `title` attribute must be added, containing the expanded form of the term.

### CSS
**What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?**
CSS can be applied to HTML through external stylesheets (linked using the `<link>` tag), internal stylesheets (defined within the `<style>` tags in the HTML document), or inline styles (applied directly to HTML elements using the `style` attribute).

**Why should we avoid using inline styles?**
Inline styles should be avoided because they mix presentation with content, making the code less maintainable and reusable. It is preferable to separate the styling concerns using external or internal stylesheets.

**Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:**

- What is representing the selector?  
The selector in the code block is represented by `h2`.

- Which components are the CSS declarations?  
The CSS declarations in the code block are `color: black;` and `padding: 5px;`.

- Which components are considered properties?  
In this case, `color` and `padding` are the properties being assigned values (`black` and `5px` respectively) within the CSS declarations.

### JS
**What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?**
A sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks represents a string data type in JavaScript.

**List 4 types of JavaScript operators:**
- Arithmetic operators (e.g., +, -, *, /)
- Assignment operators (e.g., =, +=, -=)
- Comparison operators (e.g., ==, !=, >, <)
- Logical operators (e.g., &&, ||, !)

**Describe a real-world problem you could solve with a function:**
A real-world problem that could be solved with a function is calculating the total cost of a customer's online shopping cart, considering discounts, taxes, and shipping charges. By creating a function that takes inputs such as item prices, quantities, and discount codes, the function can compute and return the final cost.

**An if statement checks a ___ and if it evaluates to ___, then the code block will execute.**
An if statement checks a condition and if it evaluates to true, then the code block will execute.

**What is the use of an else if?**
The else if statement allows for additional conditions to be checked if the initial if condition evaluates to false. It provides an alternative path of execution when multiple conditions need to be considered.

**List 3 different types of comparison operators:**
- Equal to (==)
- Not equal to (!=)
- Greater than (>)
- Less than (<)
- Greater than or equal to (>=)
- Less than or equal to (<=)

**What is the difference between the logical operator && and ||?**
The logical operator && (AND) returns true if both operands are true. It returns false if any of the operands are false.
The logical operator || (OR) returns true if either of the operands is true. It returns false only if both operands are false.
